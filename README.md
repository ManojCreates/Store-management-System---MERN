STORE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR LANKA GLASS HOUSE 

My Contribution to the Lanka Glass House Store Management System

I am responsible for two key components of the Lanka Glass House project: Cart Management for the customer side and Admin Order Management.

Customer Cart Management
Easy Item Handling: Customers can seamlessly add, edit, or remove items from their cart, giving them full control over their shopping experience.

Smart Discounting: I’ve integrated a feature that automatically applies a 5% discount when customers purchase 5 or more items, enhancing the shopping experience with special savings.

Real-Time Updates: As users make changes to their cart, everything updates instantly, keeping the experience smooth and interactive.


Admin Order Management
Efficient Order Control: On the admin side, I’ve built a powerful system that allows store managers to easily track, manage, and modify orders. Whether it's updating order details or canceling an order, everything is handled with precision.

Discount Flexibility: Admins can adjust the discount rates and promo codes at any time, ensuring that promotions are dynamic and responsive to business needs.

Detailed Order Tracking: The admin panel offers comprehensive insights into each order, making it easier to manage order fulfillment, track delivery statuses, and ensure a smooth process from start to finish.
